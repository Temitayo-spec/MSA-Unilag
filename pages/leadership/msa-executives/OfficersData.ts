            <b>What inspired you to run for (Your Post)?</b>
            <p>Over time, I’ve been under parental tutelage and that built up traits of good leadership right away from the family level coupled with the fact that I was the 2nd child having 2 sisters who were behind me of which I knew onus was on me to show them good examples worthy of emulation. The whole adventure progressed from there down to secondary school when I became the Head boy in both Junior and Secondary levels. Having been through these stages, I was inspired to push further when I got admission and then later in year 2 I had it in mind to contest for the post of the welfare Sec of the faculty when I reach year 3 but surprisingly all thanks to God and my department(Actuarial science & Insurance) They made me see reasons why I should contest for the highest position in the faculty and why I was the best man for the job. Well I guess they saw the traits while I was the Asst Governor of the class. As God will have it, the whole process came and gone, I was elected as the President of the Management Students’ Association Unilag.</p>
