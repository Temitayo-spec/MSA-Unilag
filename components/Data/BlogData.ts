    title: 'Become Your New Habit',
    content: `<p>
        Quitting an old habit or forming a new habit is fairly simple when it comes to the steps to doing it: find your trigger and do a new habit at that trigger over and over. Remind yourself to do it. Make it rewarding.

The simplicity is deceptive, though: there are some physical urges and even more mental habits that keep us stuck in our old patterns.

The physical urges are not so hard: if you stay away from an old habit (like cigarettes) for a week, the urges die down. It’s the mental habits that trip us up. We have a way of seeing ourselves that includes our old habits (like smoking, eating a certain way, etc.) and so we form a bunch of mental habits that keep us stuck in that version of ourselves. Here’s a method that will change everything for you: <b>become your new habit.</b></p>
        <p>
        Let’s take a concrete example:

1. You want to quit smoking (or quit scrolling on your phone, etc).
2. It’s hard becaus when you feel stress, you want to smoke. It’s your coping mechanism. This is how you see yourself.
3. Instead, you tell yourself: “I’m a person who meditates or goes for a walk when I’m stressed.” You visualize this new version of yourself, and how healthy and alive they’ll feel.
4. When you get stressed and have an urge to smoke, simply remind yourself of who you are now. You deal with stress by meditating or going for a walk.
5. Become that person by meditating and going for walks whenever you’re stressed. Your mental image of yourself will change, and smoking won’t even be an option.
This is how it worked for me with smoking — I stopped seeing myself as a smoker, and for the last 16 years I haven’t even considered smoking when I’ve gotten stressed.
<br />
The same thing happened when I went vegetarian and then vegan: the idea of eating meat or other animal products isn’t even appealing to me anymore, because it’s not who I am. I did this over and over: I see myself as someone who is active, who eats whole plant foods, who meditates, who is a loving father and husband, who creates meaningful things.
<br />
Change your self-image. Obliterate your old ideas. Become the new version of yourself.
</p>
<h1>Create a New Version of Yourself</h1>
<p>If you believe you are someone who exercises every day, then being sedentary for days in a row is not really an option. You get up and move.

If you believe that you eat compassionately, then meat isn’t an option. You eat plants.

If you believe that you are kind, then yelling at your kids isn’t an option. You give them love.

What’s the new version of yourself you’d like to become?

Visualize that new version of you. Feel what it would feel like. It’s an act of creativity, an act of imagination.

Create that new version of yourself. How do they feel, how do they act, what do they do when they are stressed, how do they react to difficult situations?

Now become that person. Become the new being you conjured up.</p>

    title: '3 Questions to Create Your Life',
    content: `<p>
        Very often, the way we live our lives is that we go through the motions — we do our work, try our best, tackle the things we have to do, take on our obligations, or we slack off on those obligations and find comforts where we can.

What we often forget is that no matter what, we’re creating our lives.

What if we took a more intentional approach, and created our lives on purpose?

What if we took life as a blank slate, and decided what we really wanted it to look like? What if we felt empowered to choose, to create, to bring to life what our hearts really wanted?

In this post, I’m going to share three questions to seriously take on, if you want to create your life.

I highly encourage you to take these on with full commitment. Pour yourself into them, don’t just read and think about them. Set time aside, go for a walk, take along a notebook, and really create something here. It’s your life you’re creating.</p>
<h2>Question 1: What Do You Want to Create?</h2>
<p>
If you could have anything you wanted in life, what would it be? Not just possessions (though those too) … relationships, an experience of life, a way of being, a way of living.

What does your heart really want? Why do you care about that? Why does it matter?

For example, some things my heart wants include:

Serve people by helping them be with their fears, and create their meaningful lives
Deeply intimate and nourishing relationships (wife, kids, family, friends, my team)
Vibrant and strong health
Adventure, curiosity, wonder
A house on the beach, with daily dives into the ocean
I am actively creating those things (the house on the beach is a ways off though). I’m only actively creating them because I decided I really want to create them — they’re what my heart is calling for.

Spend some time feeling into what you want to create in your life. What matters to you? Are you willing to do what it takes to create those, including stepping out of your comfort zone? If not, you might consider that comfort is the thing you want most.

Don’t worry about getting the list right. Just put what comes up for you. You can always evolve the list, like any creation. But write it down. Talk to others about it. Go for walks and contemplate some more.</p>
<h2>Question 2: What Do You Tend to Do When Resistance Meets Those Actions?</h2>
<p>
Start to take the actions each day. Put a short list of required actions (and what they’re helping create) in front of you each day.

Do a review at the end of each day and each week: how’s it going? What’s getting in the way? What do you need to adjust?
</p>
<b>More importantly: what is your tendency when the actions are met with resistance?</b>
<p>
Do you tend to go to distractions, comforts, busywork, beating yourself up? Overwork, addiction, perfectionism, hiding?

This is where things get real. Up until this moment, things were just abstractions. When we meet resistance, our patterns show up. These patterns and the fears that lead to them are exactly why we haven’t created the life we want yet. They’re why we let ourselves fall into routine and obligation. It’s not our way to face the fears.

The work begins here: turn towards the fears and be with them. Love them. Live the life you want to create in the moment when the fears show up: for me, that means being with the fears with a sense of curiosity, wonder, adventure. Intimacy, nourishment, service. Vibrancy and strength. Diving into the fears like I’d dive into the ocean — with relish and love.

How do you want to live when the fears show up?

Creating the life you want means living it, as you create it.

What will you create from this moment forward?</p>
